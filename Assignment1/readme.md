# Backpropagation implementation


## Description
Implement a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to predict if one can survive in the Titanic tragedy.

Any tools for automatic differentiation are forbidden in this homework, such as Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, MXNet, et cetera.
## Dataset
This dataset is collected from a Kaggle competition and cleaned by TAs. 

The features include: 
1. sex
2. age of a person
3. how many parents or children
4. how many siblings or spouses are on board related to the person
5. the ticket class and the passenger fare are also included.
